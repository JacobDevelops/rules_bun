# rules_bun rule reference

This file documents the public rules exported from `@rules_bun//bun:defs.bzl`.

## js_binary

Runs a JS/TS entry point with Bun behind a `rules_js`-style name.

Attributes:

- `entry_point` (label, required): path to the main JS/TS file to execute.
- `node_modules` (label, optional): package files from a `node_modules` tree, typically produced by `bun_install` or `npm_translate_lock`, made available in runfiles.
- `data` (label_list, optional): additional runtime files.
- `deps` (label_list, optional): library dependencies required by the program.
- `args` (string_list, optional): default arguments appended before command-line arguments passed to the binary.
- `working_dir` (string, default: `"workspace"`, values: `"workspace" | "entry_point"`): runtime working directory.

## js_test

Runs Bun tests behind a `rules_js`-style name.

Attributes:

- `srcs` (label_list, required): test source files passed to `bun test`.
- `node_modules` (label, optional): package files from a `node_modules` tree, typically produced by `bun_install` or `npm_translate_lock`, made available in runfiles.
- `deps` (label_list, optional): library dependencies required by tests.
- `data` (label_list, optional): additional runtime files needed by tests.
- `args` (string_list, optional): default arguments appended after the test source list.

## js_run_devserver

Runs an executable target from a staged JS workspace.

Attributes:

- `tool` (label, required): executable target to launch as the dev server.
- `args` (string_list, optional): default arguments appended before command-line arguments passed to the dev server.
- `package_json` (label, optional): package manifest used to resolve the package working directory.
- `package_dir_hint` (string, default: `"."`): package-relative directory hint when `package_json` is omitted.
- `node_modules` (label, optional): package files from a `node_modules` tree, typically produced by `bun_install` or `npm_translate_lock`, made available in runfiles.
- `deps` (label_list, optional): library dependencies required by the dev server.
- `data` (label_list, optional): additional runtime files.
- `working_dir` (string, default: `"workspace"`, values: `"workspace" | "package"`): runtime working directory.

## bun_binary

Runs a JS/TS entry point with Bun as an executable target (`bazel run`).

Attributes:

- `entry_point` (label, required): path to the main JS/TS file to execute.
- `node_modules` (label, optional): package files from a `node_modules` tree, typically produced by `bun_install`, made available in runfiles.
- `data` (label_list, optional): additional runtime files.
- `deps` (label_list, optional): library dependencies required by the program.
- `args` (string_list, optional): default arguments appended before command-line arguments passed to the binary.
- `working_dir` (string, default: `"workspace"`, values: `"workspace" | "entry_point"`): runtime working directory.

## bun_dev

Runs a JS/TS entry point in Bun development watch mode (`bazel run`).

Attributes:

- `entry_point` (label, required): path to the main JS/TS file.
- `watch_mode` (string, default: `"watch"`, values: `"watch" | "hot"`): Bun live-reload mode.
- `restart_on` (label_list, optional): files that trigger full process restart when changed.
- `node_modules` (label, optional): package files from a `node_modules` tree, typically produced by `bun_install`, made available in runfiles.
- `data` (label_list, optional): additional runtime files for dev process.
- `working_dir` (string, default: `"workspace"`, values: `"workspace" | "entry_point"`): runtime working directory.

## bun_script

Runs a named `package.json` script with Bun as an executable target (`bazel run`).

Recommended for package-script based tools such as Vite (`dev`, `build`, `preview`).
When `node_modules` is provided, executables from `node_modules/.bin` are added
to `PATH`, so scripts like `vite` work without wrapper scripts.

Attributes:

- `script` (string, required): package script name passed to `bun run <script>`.
- `package_json` (label, required): `package.json` file containing the named script.
- `node_modules` (label, optional): package files from a `node_modules` tree, typically produced by `bun_install`, made available in runfiles.
- `data` (label_list, optional): additional runtime files for the script.
- `working_dir` (string, default: `"package"`, values: `"workspace" | "package"`): runtime working directory. The default is a good fit for Vite and similar package-script based tools.

## bun_bundle

Bundles one or more JS/TS entry points with Bun build.

Attributes:

- `entry_points` (label_list, required): entry files to bundle.
- `node_modules` (label, optional): package files from a `node_modules` tree, typically produced by `bun_install`, used for package resolution.
- `deps` (label_list, optional): source/library dependencies for transitive inputs.
- `data` (label_list, optional): additional non-source files needed during bundling.
- `target` (string, default: `"browser"`, values: `"browser" | "node" | "bun"`): Bun build target.
- `format` (string, default: `"esm"`, values: `"esm" | "cjs" | "iife"`): module format.
- `minify` (bool, default: `False`): minifies bundle output.
- `sourcemap` (bool, default: `False`): emits source maps.
- `external` (string_list, optional): package names treated as external (not bundled).

## bun_test

Runs Bun tests as a Bazel test target (`bazel test`).

Attributes:

- `srcs` (label_list, required): test source files passed to `bun test`.
- `node_modules` (label, optional): package files from a `node_modules` tree, typically produced by `bun_install`, made available in runfiles.
- `deps` (label_list, optional): library dependencies required by tests.
- `data` (label_list, optional): additional runtime files needed by tests.
- `args` (string_list, optional): default arguments appended after the test source list.

## js_library

Attributes:

- `srcs` (label_list, optional): `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` files.
- `types` (label_list, optional): `.d.ts` files propagated to dependents.
- `data` (label_list, optional): runtime files propagated to dependents.
- `deps` (label_list, optional): dependent source libraries.

## ts_library
